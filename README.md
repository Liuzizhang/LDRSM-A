Railway Point Machines are critical for train routing and safety. Traditional fault diagnosis methods are often computationally heavy and impractical for real-time use. LDRSM-a addresses this by integrating:

Feature Extraction Module (FEM): Multi-scale convolutional layers with depthwise separable convolutions.

Temporal Modeling Module (TMM): BiGRU with temporal attention mechanism.

Classification Module (CM): Fully connected layers for fault classification.

The model is optimized for low latency and minimal memory footprint, enabling on-site diagnostics via handheld devices.
